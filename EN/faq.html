                This Jam is 100% to be hosted on site. Of course, we’re not locking anyone anywhere. You can go out whenever you want, but just remember to come back to work on your project. The game project MUST be worked only inside your jam site. So if you want to go out to eat, sleep at home, attend your cousin bar-mitzvah, please do. But you won’t be permitted to work on your project while outside.

                Yes, yup and of course you can! As said before, making games is a multidisciplinary activity, and GJ+ is an event that recognizes that. Remember that there will be a business pitch, so people with marketing, business, advertising and monetization knowledge can participate (and other specializations too!). Do you have a friend that is awesome doing business pitches? Why not asking him to join your team? Making games for a living is not restricted to only making the game, <span class="text--black">remember that at all times!</span>
